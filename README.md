## About

A personal monorepo containing all of my personal coding adventures. From courses, personal ideas or just something I do for fun eventually.

## Project Structure

Every folder is basically a project. The folder name may start with the language used for better organization.

The idea of this repository is to be, as the repository name implies, a master `book of essential information` on my coding career.

Every project has its own documentation with more information about the project (or the idea behind it).
