<img src="./docs/logo.png" alt="Move It Logo">

This project is being developed during the fourth edition of the #NextLevelWeek.

The main idea of this app is to help users exercise between long sessions of work, with the use of gamification.

But the main ideia of this whole project is to learn about `React` and `Next.js`, and take your knowledge to the `Next Level`.
