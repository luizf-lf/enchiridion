# windows

## About

A Windows 10 interface implementation example using the holy trinity (HTML/CSS/JavaScript).

## Features

- A frosted glass window.
- A randomized "desktop" background every time the page is loaded. (It uses the [Unsplash Source API](https://source.unsplash.com/))
- A randomized inspirational quote displayed on the main window. (It uses another API, this time it's from [Quotable](https://github.com/lukePeavey/quotable))

## Tips

- Click the window maximize button to see the full resolution wallpaper from Unsplash.
- On the taskbar, click the Google Photos icon to set a new wallpaper. (It will revert to a "default" image if Unsplash returns a 404)
- Also, click the Telegram icon to set a new quote.
